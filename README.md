# MoleClassifier

The server side implementation of an app that will use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to predict whether or 
not a mole is malignant or benign based on past datasets.

This idea is based on this research paper by the UPenn: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cse400/CSE400_2014_2015/reports/20_report.pdf
